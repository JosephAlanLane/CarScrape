# CarScrape
My girlfriend is looking to buy a new car.

So I made a craigslist scraper that records 'good' deals and emails
them to her. 

Good deals are found when the ratio between the CL posted asking
price divided by the low end of the KBB recommeneded listing price is less than 1. 

Example panda dataframe before being emailed:
